# Vehicle Counter System using Python and OpenCV

## Overview
Efficiently monitoring and managing traffic flow has become more crucial in modern urban areas. Exact, up-to-date data on vehicle counts are necessary for transportation agencies, traffic engineers, and urban planners to create better-informed judgments about congestion reduction, infrastructure development, and traffic optimization. This project presents an all-encompassing analysis and evaluation of systems that count vehicles, scrutinizing their underlying principles, technologies, challenges, and prospective uses.

## Abstract
This work presents a comprehensive overview of vehicle counting systems, methodologies, and technologies, with a focus on implementing a vehicle counter system using Python and the OpenCV library for object detection. By leveraging computer vision techniques, this project aims to accurately count and classify vehicles in various traffic scenarios, providing valuable data for traffic monitoring and optimization.
